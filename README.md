# Twitter_Banner_Updater

Twitter banner updater. That's literally it.

Note #1: You need to have an existing Twitter API project with 'elevated' access to the API, otherwise this code will not function.

Note #2: the config.ini file in this repo is simply a placeholder for you to put your own keys into from your Twitter API project; it does not contain anything from my own project for obvious security reasons.
