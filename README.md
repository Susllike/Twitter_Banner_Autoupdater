# Twitter Banner Autoupdater

**NOTE: in order to use this repo you need to have an existing Twitter API project with "elevated" access to the API, otherwise this code will not function. The config.ini file in this repo is simply a placeholder for you to put your own keys and tokens from your Twitter API project; it does not contain anything from my own project for obvious security reasons.**

"I wonder if I can spice up my Twitter banner somehow..."

Well, this banner autoupdater does exactly that (and a little more!)

Your banner will automatically update with your most recent follower on it, which might encourage other people seeing your profile to follow you in order to get on your banner as well.

With the most recent version, your followers will also get a Direct Message welcoming and thanking them for following you, which might make them engage with you and your content more since they are being acknowledged.

The whole thing is completely automatic after the setup and only requires a stable Wi-Fi connection.

### Example:
My base banner image looks like this, and the code is hardcoded exactly to it, so if you have your own template you will have to change the numbers to fit your template.
